<!-- FEDERATED LEARNING TUTORIAL -->
## Know before you go

Hi there and Welcome to this tutorial :smiley:

As you might have seen on the [event agenda](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/en/MICCAI2022-TUTORIALS.html) on the 22nd of September there will be a "Federated Learning for Healthcare Tutorial" where you will have the chance to learn how to set up a complete federated learning (FL) environment and conduct FL experiments for both classification and segmentation workloads

The 3.5 hour tutorial will be split in 3 parts:
1. "Getting Started": 45 minutes, dedicated to environment setup for those who would like to use their own machines, optional
2. "Considerations for Federated Learning": 45 minutes, A primer for Federated Learning, comparison with other techniques, aggregation methods, learnings from the largest known real-world global federation [FeTS](https://www.fets.ai/) and other use cases, Security and Privacy implications followed by a Q&A session. optional   
2. "Advanced session: mastering OpenFL": 2h session, required

The first session will be focused on how to create the correct python environment to install the [Open Federated Learning (OpenFL) library](https://github.com/intel/openfl), which has facilitated the largest to-date real-world FL study, while the second will include hands-on advanced exercises.
 
Since the assumption for the advanced session is that you will have access to a working environment properly configured, you will have the freedom to choose whether you would like to install the environment by yourself prior to the event, or during the first hour of the session together with us.

If you would like to play with the instructions on your own machine before getting to the Summer School, please follow [these](https://github.com/intel/fl-tutorial/blob/gh-pages/create_fl_env.txt) instructions. They should be straightforward to follow, but in case you would benefit from having additional resources guiding you through the process, here there is a [video tutorial](https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/now/ai-video-series/building-the-federation.html) for you.

If you can successfully run the "test_hello_federation.sh" script without error, or if you would like to use a preconfigured Google Colab environment, you are welcome to join the workshop 45 minutes later, for Introduction to Federated Learning.

In case you don't have time to prepare or simply prefer to wait for the MICCAI tutorial, no problem: we will be happy to go through the process together.

Regardless to what option you choose to follow, please be aware that the preferred OS for having a working environment locally installed on your machines is Linux (>=20.04LTS) with Python 3.6,3.7 or 3.8.

We are looking forward to meeting you there! :sunglasses:
